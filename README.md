# RGB CAMERAS

## ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose
This project explores the operation principles, applications, and technical implementations of **RGB-D cameras** (capturing both color and depth information). It reviews existing technologies, market devices, and current trends, while presenting two Intel RealSenseâ€“based algorithms tested in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ’» Implementation
### Algorithm 1
- **Goal:** Capture RGB and depth data, calculate distance to center point  
- **Hardware:** Intel RealSense camera  
- **Output:** RGB image + depth map with distance overlay  

### Algorithm 2
- **Goal:** Detect and track objects of a specific color  
- **Process:** HSV masking, contour detection, rectangle and line drawing
